## Introduction
Classes for combining all of the DAB algorithms into a coherent radio application. 

This is just an example implementation which has the following features:
1. Browse through all audio channels
2. Decode DAB+ audio channels (DAB not supported yet)
    - Toggle programme associated data decoding
    - Toggle audio data decoding
    - Toggle audio playback through speakers
    - Display programme associated data
        - Dynamic labels
        - MOT slideshows
3. View detailed information of all existing DAB database entities
    - Intended for academic purposes. A commerical implementation would hide most of this.
