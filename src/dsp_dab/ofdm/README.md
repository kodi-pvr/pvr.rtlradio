## Description
Contains code that is used for demodulating a raw OFDM IQ signal into a digital OFDM frame. 

## Usage
All the algorithms here are self contained and platform independent. These are just example implementations of how you can build an OFDM demodulator.
This is intended to be used as an analog to digital block that feeds OFDM digital frames to the DAB decoder.

## Source
This particular implementation is heavily based on the document provided in docs/DAB_implementation_in_SDR_detailed.pdf.
